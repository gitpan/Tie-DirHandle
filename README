I.  Brief Description
---------------------

Tie::DirHandle allows for <HANDLE> syntax to be used on a tied filehandle to
a directory handle.  That's basically it.  There's not much support for a tied
directory, since they can't be written to.

NAME
    Tie::DirHandle - definitions for tied directory handles

SYNOPSIS
        use Tie::DirHandle;
        
        [$ref =] tie *FH, "Tie::DirHandle", *DH, "/usr/local/lib";
        while (<FH>){
            do_something_with_file($_);
        }
        (tied *FH)->rewind; # or $ref->rewind;
        untie *FH;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides filehandle-like read access to directory
    handles. There are not many available methods, because directory
    handles are read-only. The only methods are `TIEHANDLE',
    `READLINE', `DESTROY', and `rewind'.

    To tie a filehandle to a directory handle, the syntax is as
    follows: tie *FILEHANDLE, "Tie::DirHandle", *DIRHANDLE,
    "/path/to/dir";

    The module will open the directory (and croak with an error if
    not able to do so). When untying the filehandle, the directory
    is closed.

    After a filehandle has been tied to a directory handle, you can
    read from the directory using the <HANDLE> syntax. This syntax
    calls `READLINE'.

    To rewind the directory, there are two possible syntaxes: (tied
    *FH)->rewind; or $ref->rewind;

    The second works if you have stored the return value of the tie
    in a variable $ref. The value of `tied *FH' and $ref are the
    same.

    The variable $ref (or `tied *FH') contains a hash reference,
    with three keys. $ref->{HANDLE} returns the directory handle it
    references. $ref->{PATH} and $ref->{DIR} are synonymous, and
    return the path of the directory.

    TIEHANDLE classname, DIRHANDLE, DIR
        This ties the specified directory handle to the filehandle
        given as the first argument to tie(). DIR is the pathname of
        the directory.

    READLINE this
        This returns the next value (if called in a scalar context)
        or the next values (if returned in a list context) of
        readdir().

    DESTROY this
        This closes the directory.

    function.
